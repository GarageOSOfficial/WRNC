## 🎯 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

**Welcome to WRNC Alpha Testing!**

You've been selected as a **Plank Owner** – an early adopter who will help shape the future of vehicle build documentation. Your feedback during this alpha phase is critical to making WRNC the essential tool for builders worldwide.

### What You're Testing

**WRNC v0.1.0-alpha** - The Vehicle Workspace, the center of the entire application where builders manage, document, and track their vehicle projects.

### Key Capabilities (v0.1.0)

- ✅ **Mission Control Dashboard** - View all your vehicles at a glance
- ✅ **Vehicle Workspace** - Central hub for vehicle management
- ✅ **Overview Tab** - Quick summary of vehicle status
- ✅ **Photos Tab** - Visual documentation with hero photo
- ✅ **About Tab** - Vehicle details and metadata
- ✅ **Activity Feed** - Permanent record of all work
- ✅ **iOS App** - Mobile-first native experience

### What's NOT in v0.1.0 (Coming Later)

- Timeline view (v0.4)
- Inventory tracking (v0.5)
- Budget planning (v0.6)
- Service records (v0.7)
- Build summary reports (v0.8)

---

## 🏗️ WHAT IS GARAGE OS

### The Problem

Builders document their projects manually across multiple apps and files:
- Photos scattered across phone and cloud
- Notes in text files or notes apps
- History lost or forgotten
- No timeline of decisions made
- Difficult to share progress with friends/partners

### The Solution

**WRNC** - A single source of truth for everything about your vehicle.

Every action, photo, and decision is recorded as an immutable **Activity**. This creates a complete, auditable history that's impossible to lose or corrupt.

### Core Philosophy

1. **Builders Before Developers** - We optimize for builder productivity, not technical elegance
2. **Photos Are the Hero** - Visual documentation is primary
3. **Activities Are Sacred** - Every change is recorded and permanent
4. **Archive, Never Delete** - Nothing is ever lost
5. **Mobile First** - Native iOS experience optimized for touch
6. **Less Typing, More Building** - Minimize friction

---

## 🔐 ARCHITECTURE BASELINE v0.3.4

The application architecture is **FROZEN** at v0.3.4. This means certain core decisions cannot change without explicit approval, while implementation details can iterate.

### Locked Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Status | What It Means |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Activities Are Single Source of Truth | 🔒 LOCKED | All vehicle history flows from Activities |
| Archive, Never Delete | 🔒 LOCKED | Deleted items are hidden, never erased |
| Vehicle Workspace is Center | 🔒 LOCKED | All work happens in the Vehicle Workspace |
| Mission Control is Dashboard | 🔒 LOCKED | Mission Control is read-only overview |

### Active Architectural Decisions (Can Iterate)

- Activity presentation rules (Build vs System Activities)
- Photo pipeline optimization
- Synchronization strategy
- State management approach
- Inline edit mode implementation

**Why Frozen?**
- Provides stability for alpha testing
- Prevents scope creep
- Allows focused feedback on core experience
- Ensures consistency across features

---

## 🧪 TESTING SCENARIOS

Use these scenarios to explore the app naturally. There's no "right way" – use the app how you would naturally document your vehicle.

### Scenario 1: Initial Documentation (Week 1)

**Goal:** Establish baseline documentation

1. Create 3-5 Activities documenting:
   - Current vehicle state
   - Recent modifications
   - Planned projects
   - Equipment/tools used

2. Add multiple photos per activity
3. Edit vehicle details in About tab
4. Review activity history in Overview

**Questions to Consider:**
- Does the interface feel intuitive?
- Is photo upload fast and reliable?
- Can you easily find what you documented?

---

### Scenario 2: Ongoing Documentation (Week 2-3)

**Goal:** Test real-world usage patterns

1. Document actual work sessions:
   - Parts installed
   - Maintenance performed
   - Progress updates
   - Problems encountered

2. Share screenshots of work with team
3. Update vehicle details as plans change
4. Review historical activities

**Questions to Consider:**
- Is the app performant?
- Do activities sync reliably?
- Can you find historical context when needed?

---

### Scenario 3: Edge Cases (Week 3-4)

**Goal:** Find unexpected behaviors

1. Test with poor network connectivity
2. Close app mid-activity (force quit)
3. Take many photos rapidly
4. Leave app open for hours
5. Rapid switching between tabs

**Questions to Consider:**
- Does data survive crashes?
- Are activities saved reliably?
- Does sync catch up after reconnect?
